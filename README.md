# Flowpilot stand alone
This is a fork of Flowpilot without the need of rooting or a Termux environment. Install the apk and you're done. Requires a Snapdragon based Android phone.

Main features of this fork:
* Standalone apk without additional software requirements
* Android device rooting is not required
* Improved UI resolution

Huge shout out to the original [Flowpilot](https://github.com/flowdriveai/flowpilot) and [Phr00t's fork](https://github.com/phr00t/flowpilot).

# Building notes

* `git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/Dennis-NL/flowpilot.git`
* `git checkout -b MLB origin/MLB`
